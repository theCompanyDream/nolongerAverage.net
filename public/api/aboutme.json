I don't enjoy baseball, the charleston, or <a href=\"http://wowwiki.wikia.com/wiki/Pygmy\">pygmies</a>.</p><p>This is what is called an informal resume so not only do you get to learn a bout my skills but you get to see my bubbly personality. Please enjoy but like planet fitness this is a no judgement zone so give positive feed back and constructuive critism is not welcome. Happy thoughts </p>",
